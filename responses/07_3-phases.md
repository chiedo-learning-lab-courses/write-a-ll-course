    # Have you ever thought about what teaching _is_? What are the behaviors that a good teacher has to make it easy to learn? Maybe you have - and maybe you haven't. 
    # Let's break down teaching into three steps: telling the learner what to do, watching them to see if they do it or not, and then giving them specific feedback about what they did or didn't do right. Repeat! That may sound simple, but it's the basis of fast feedback that is _learning_. :rainbow: 
    # Just like we broke down your teaching goal into smaller steps, let's break down _teaching_ in the same way. Let's focus on one learning objective...the smallest possible unit of behavior we can identify. 
    # For starters, let's choose writing unordered lists in Markdown. That's what we want the user to know how to do. Let's apply those three phases.
    # Phase 1: Telling the learner what to do - what does the learner need to be able to exhibit the behavior that we want? Well, they'd need to know about Markdown, and it'd be nice if they had a computer with a keyboard, and a place to type the text. Let's assume those contextual things are taken care of. The main information that a learner would need would be, what is an unordered list? How is that written in Markdown? Then, we'd ask the user to do that.
    # Phase 2: The learner does it and we watch - there's an important part of this step. It's not just the learner doing it, but it's how we are going to watch and observe if they did it correctly or not. In Learning Lab, this is usually an issue comment or a commit changing a file. We give them the space to try it out, and we watch via webhooks. We use gates to "check" if they did what we asked them to.
    # Phase 3: We give the learner feedback - based on the detailed and keen observation in the second phase, we can give them the feedback they need to either validate that they learned it correctly, or let them know that they _didn't_ do it correctly, and they should try again. It's important to give the most specific feedback as possible. This is similar to unit tests - if they're vague, they're not really helpful. The more personalized and exact the feedback can be, the more quickly and accurately the learner will understand what they did right and/or wrong.
    # This is how _all_ learning happens, through feedback, whether it's from a teacher in a classroom, a bot like me, or a stovetop that gives you the feedback "if you touch me, it HURTS!". Faster and more exact feedback is always a better teacher.
    # This is the process that we are going to use for each of the learning objectives you've written. 
    # Before we start writing some for this course, let's practice identifying this three phase process. I've written four examples below - some of which are examples of this three phase process, and some of which _aren't_. For each example, there is a label. For each example that _is_ a good example of the three phases, add the corresponding issue label to this pull request. Once all of them match what I expect, I'll give you the next instructions.
    # If you get stuck, add the issue label "help" and I'll give you some more detail. (include instructions for how to add labels)

## Step 7: Choose the example that shows the three phases
