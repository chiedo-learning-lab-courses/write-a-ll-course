 # Alright - you've gotten a project chosen, and you've laid out the steps for your learners. Next, we're going to get into something new with Learning Lab: events!
    # An `event` is the webhook that the learner triggers, and it's how Learning Lab knows that it should do something.
    # Some of the most common examples are: x. Next, your job is to map your learning objectives to events. 
    # You may want to start ordering them now, but it's OK if you're not sure.
    # This step will reveal some things about your course, so it's important to pay attention.
    # How can each learning objective or step be translated through a GitHub event? A risk here is to have too many of the same type of events, or to have events represent things that aren't actually what you're trying to teach.
    # For example, you may want to show a lot of information to the learner, and then have them close the issue to signifiy they've read it. That may make sense for one or two steps in your course, but imagine going through a whole course like that - it isn't actually checking if the learner read - it's checking if the learner knows how to close issues!
    # Try to choose events that correspond directly to what you want the learner to do. If you're trying to teach the learner to import a npm module into a `package.json` file, have the event be the actual commit of the user doing that.
    # I've taken your steps from earlier, and put them as a comment in this issue. Copy those steps, and find an event that matches. Here's where you find them all. Just do the first one, which I've already defined for you.
