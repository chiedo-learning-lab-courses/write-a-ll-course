# Congratulations!

So, you've done it - you've started your own Learning Lab course. I will leave you here with the last set of instructions:

### Complete this course by following the three phase approach

- Phase 1 - tell the learner what to do.
- Phase 2 - watch if they do it.
- Phase 3 - tell them if they did it or not.

Remember, the "events" or "gates" should be as literally and closely mapped to the learning objective as possible.

### Choosing public vs private courses

Learning Lab courses are public by default. If you'd like to create private courses, you can sign up for the organization plan. Contact learninglab@github.com to learn more.

### Publish a course

When you're ready to [publish your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/publishing), just go to your course's dashboard and click the button! Once published, other users can register for and take your course.

### Maintaining launched courses

Once a course is published, you can continue to make updates to it by using pull requests. When you create a branch and a pull request in an existing course, Learning Lab will automatically create a draft deployment of that pull request so you can test. There will be links directly in your pull request, so you should be able to find it easily. These drafts are only accessible to the owner, or if the owner is an organization, those with administrator access.

### Using the Course Builder

This Learning Lab course has walked you through course creation from scratch - but we also have a Course Builder UI. The Course Builder will create a boilerplate repository and automatically import it for you. It also provides helpful tools to create and validate your course's yaml file.
If you need help, reach out in the [community forum]({{ communityBoard }}), or let us know at learninglab@github.com.
