# Congratulations!

So, you've done it - you've started your own Learning Lab course. I will leave you here with the last set of instructions:
- Complete this course by following the three phase approach. 
  - Phase 1 - tell the learner what to do.
  - Phase 2 - watch if they do it.
  - Phase 3 - tell them if they did it or not.
- Remember, the "events" or "gates" should be as literally and closely mapped to the learning objective as possible.

If you need help, reach out in the {{ communityBoard }}, or let us know at learninglab@github.com.
