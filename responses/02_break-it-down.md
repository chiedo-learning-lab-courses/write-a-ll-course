    # Great! When you commented, you triggered something called a webhook that I heard, and now I'm here! You may be wondering if I checked to see if  what you wrote was a _real_ topic. We'll talk about that kind of logic later - both how to use it, and when to use it. (Spoiler - for this step, I didn't check! I am pretty smart, but not smart enough to tell if you typed a good idea or not.)

    # Now that you know what you want to teach, the next thing to do is break it down into steps. This can be tricky - put on a teacher hat and an engineer hat at the same time. 
    # To break down the thing you want to teach, think about the observable behaviors that show that the user is doing it right. If you were watching this person, how would you know they've mastered the thing? Some exapmles are: this.
    # What NOT to do: have huge or ambiguous steps. Ex: Write an app! 
    # In the file in this pull request, write the steps as observable behaviors. It's OK if there are a lot - it's better to break it down into the right size of steps, then realize the scope of the course is wrong, than to have HUGE steps.
