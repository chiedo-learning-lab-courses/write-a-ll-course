# Course metadata
  
Awesome work so far! Now, you've officially got your first step written. It's a good time to try this course out. Before we do, we need to pay some attention to the metadata in the config file, so that Learning Lab knows what to do with it.
  
The parts that we need now are the title, description, name of the learner's repo. Learning Lab also needs more detail around each step. The information is there in detail in comments in the config file.

Here are a few examples:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github/blob/master/config.yml)
```
title: Introduction to GitHub
tagline: Your sidekick for getting started on GitHub
description: If you are looking for a quick and fun introduction to GitHub, you've found it. This class will get you started using GitHub in less than an hour.
template:
  name: github-slideshow
  repo: caption-this-template
  description: 'A robot powered training repository :robot:'
```
- [Communicating Using Markdown](https://github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown/blob/master/config.yml)
```
title: "Communicating using Markdown"
tagline: "Your guide to mastering Markdown"
description: "This course will walk you through everything you need to start organizing ideas and collaborating using Markdown, a lightweight language for text formatting."
template:
  name: "markdown-portfolio"
  repo: "communicating-using-md-template"
```
- [This course - Writing a Learning Lab course](https://github.com/githubtraining/write-a-ll-course/blob/master/config.yml)
```
title: Write a Learning Lab course
tagline: Learn how to author your own Learning Lab course.
description: Use Learning Lab's strengths for fast feedback to author your own course.
template:
  name: lab-starter
  repo: write-a-ll-course-template
```

## Step 13: Create course metadata

**Important:** Make sure the name is different than the name of this repository, or else you'll have some trouble taking the course yourself.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the course metadata like title and description to the configuration file

1. [Edit the config file]({{ url }}) (lines x, y, and z) so the comments are gone, and your information is there.
