  # 6.1
    # I want to reiterate how important it is to choose events that correlate as directly as possible to what you're asking the learner to do.
    # Ideally, if you're not using gates or other tests, the event _should_ be what you're asking the learner to do. 
    # Go ahead and put in the events for the rest of the learning objectives. You can use this time to re-order them in a way that makes sense to you for a flow of a course.
