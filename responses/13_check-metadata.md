I noticed that your commit to the `config.yml` file doesn't have what I am expecting.

I'm using a `gate` and using regular expressions to check that you have something committed that looks like:

```
title: Write a Learning Lab course
tagline: Learn how to author your own Learning Lab course.
description: Use Learning Lab's strengths for fast feedback to author your own course.
template:
  name: lab-starter
  repo: write-a-ll-course-template-2.0
```

Try again by [committing to the `config.yml` file on this branch]({{ url }}), and make sure your changes match my example above.
