# Choosing a Template

One of the things that makes Learning Lab special is the ability to learn a skill _in context_. As you think about what you want to teach, it's critical to think about the context that you want to teach your topic in. Most courses make use of a [:book: template repository](https://lab.github.com/docs/course-ownership-and-repositories#the-repositories). Template repositories are cloned for the learner and can contain starter code or resources to help them find their way.

The template will need to be under _the same account as the one who owns this course_, so make sure you do that now.

When creating or choosing a template repository for your course, consider two main points.

### Relevant content

First, how will this content help teach the concept? For example, if a course is teaching HTML, the success of the finished product should feature HTML.

If you're teaching JavaScript, an app makes sense. If you're teaching Markdown, maybe you don't need a project at all! With CSS, you could use a project relating to design.

Think of a project that is "real" and practical with the skill you're teaching, without introducing too many additional and possibly confusing concepts.

### Finished product

Second, is the finished product useful? At the end of the course, the finished repository should serve a purpose aside from the lessons. A working game, a portfolio or resume, or a collection of template documents are a few examples.

## Step 4: Reference the template

Select a template repository - or use ours - based on the things above. Here's how it needs to be stored. Edit the config to link to that template repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the config file to reference your chosen template repository

1. Create the repository under the same account that will own the course.
    - It doesn't have to be complete, but it should have at least one commit.
2. [Edit this file]({{ url }}) to replace the commented `repo:` under `template:` in the `config.yml` file with a title of your template repository.
    - Note: You can do this by editing the file, or accepting my suggested change.
