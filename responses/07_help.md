Can't figure out which are the right labels? No worries! Here are the reasons and the answers:

#### Example 1: Committing a header

- **Why?**: This is not a proper example because it's missing an important part of step 2. While the user does change the file, we do not check that they do what we asked. They could have committed a list instead of a header! In phase 3, we move on to the next step, which is feedback to the learner that they did what we asked them. Now, the learner just learned that a list is a header. Do not apply this label.

#### Example 2: Closing an issue

- **Why?**: In this example, we give the learner the instructions and the context they need to do what we want _and_ understand why. We also see that the learner doesn't follow the instructions that we gave. That's OK because we notice it, and redirect them to try again. We reinforce the initial instructions, but with different and/or more specific terms to give the learner a greater chance of success, and ultimately, of learning what we want them to learn. Apply this label.

#### Example 3: Fixing a bug

- **Why?**: This includes the directions for the learner, specific tests to make sure they've accomplished the goal, and direct feedback about their success. Note that there isn't a lot of context around the instructions, because the learner has gained that context in previous steps. Apply this label.
  
#### Example 4: Writing a function

- **Why?**: The instructions for this step aren't clear enough for the learner to be successful. The balance between assuming context and over-instructing was too far into assumption. The learner could become frustrated because they are following the instructions to the best of their ability, yet the course gives them no feedback. Do not apply this label.
