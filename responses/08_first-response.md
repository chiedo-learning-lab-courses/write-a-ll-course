# 3 Phases: Why?

  <br>
  
  #### Example 1: Committing a header

- **Why?**: This is not a proper example because it's missing an important part of step 2. While the user does change the file, we do not check that they do what we asked. They could have committed a list instead of a header! In phase 3, we move on to the next step, which is feedback to the learner that they did what we asked them. Now, the learner just learned that a list is a header.

#### Example 2: Closing an issue

- **Why?**: In this example, we give the learner the instructions and the context they need to do what we want _and_ understand why. We also see that the learner doesn't follow the instructions that we gave. That's OK because we notice it, and redirect them to try again. We reinforce the initial instructions, but with different and/or more specific terms to give the learner a greater chance of success, and ultimately, of learning what we want them to learn.

#### Example 3: Fixing a bug

- **Why?**: This includes the directions for the learner, specific tests to make sure they've accomplished the goal, and direct feedback about their success. Note that there isn't a lot of context around the instructions, because the learner has gained that context in previous steps.
  
#### Example 4: Writing a function

- **Why?**: The instructions for this step aren't clear enough for the learner to be successful. The balance between assuming context and over-instructing was too far into assumption. The learner could become frustrated because they are following the instructions to the best of their ability, yet the course gives them no feedback.

# Writing responses

Let's do one together before we start going into the others. If the first learning objective is based on Issues - specifically, how to open one. What do we need to do in phase one to prompt the user to demonstrate that behavior in phase two?

Now is a good time to learn about _responses_. The `response` directory is where you store the files that will be what the bot says.

## Step 8: Create the first response

To practice, I've got a file ready for you in this pull request. Go ahead and write your instructions (phase 1 for this objective) in the file in this pull request and commit.

You may notice the file name and structure. They represent the best practices we've found to make things clear for our users.

### :keyboard: Activity: Write the first response, phase 1, for the first step of your course

1. [Edit the `01_first-response.md` file]({{ url }}) and write the instructions for your first step.
    - Remember, this is _your_ course. You choose what to teach, what the steps are, and what to say!
