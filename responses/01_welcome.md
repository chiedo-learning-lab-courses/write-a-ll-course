# Welcome!

This course will walk you through creating your own Learning Lab course. If you've ever wanted to create a learning resource using Learning Lab, then you're in the right place! Together, we'll go through:

- Picking a topic
- Breaking the topic down into small steps
- Designing a learner centered course flow
- Choosing a project repository
- Mapping the small steps into GitHub events
- Writing responses
- Importing and creating your course

### Prerequisites

- **GitHub knowledge**: For this course, you'll need to know how to use GitHub to work with text files. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github). If you need a refresher on Markdown, check out [the Communicating using Markdown course]({{ host}}/courses/communicating-using-markdown).
- **Webhooks & the GitHub API**: You'll also need a general understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API.  Try [the Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps).

### Choosing a topic

The first thing we're going to do is talk about and choose a topic.

You may already have something in mind for your first course. In this course, you can actually start writing that idea and making it reality! If you're just curious about how to write a course or don't have an idea (yet), try  Markdown as a topic.

Here are some things to think about as you select your topic:

#### Things that work with GitHub

Does it happen on GitHub anyway? Learning Lab is best when it's working with something that it can interact with naturally. Things like painting would be difficult! Commits or interactions with GitHub are the perfect fit.

#### Scope and size

What's the scope or size? For example, JavaScript makes a lot of sense to teach on Learning Lab because code happens on GitHub. But, it's a really big topic. It may be a good idea to segment your topic into smaller parts. Remember, users can take a series of Labs. If you aren't sure what the right size is, that's OK - that should become more clear as we go on.

## Step 1: Choose a topic for your course

Whether you choose your own topic or one of ours, you'll stick with the same one throughout this course. Don't worry, you don't have to publish it right away - we'll show you how to keep your course hidden as a _Draft_ until you are ready to show it to the world.

### :keyboard: Activity: Tell us what you'd like to teach

1. Please comment below with the subject that you'd like to teach in your Learning Lab course. If you don't have an idea yet, you can use Markdown as your topic.
