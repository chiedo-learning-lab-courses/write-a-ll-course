# Welcome!

This is what this course is: 

### Prerequisites

### Choosing a topic

The first thing we're going to do is talk about and choose a topic. 

If you'd like to teach something on Learning Lab, you probably already have something in mind. For this course, you can actually start writing that idea and making it reality! If you're just curious about how to write a course and would rather use our idea, here are a few: like that.

### Things that work with GitHub

Here are some things to think about: Does it happen on GitHub anyway? Learning Lab is best when it's working with something that it can interact with naturally. Things like painting would be difficult! But things that are committed, or interacted with on GitHub, are the perfect fit.

### Scope and size

What's the scope or size? For example, JavaScript makes a lot of sense to teach on Learning Lab because code happens on GitHub. But, it's a really big topic. It may be a good idea to segment your topic into smaller parts, that can be their own Labs, and then users can take a series of Labs. If you aren't sure what the right size is, that's OK - that should become more clear as we go on.

## Step 1: Choose a topic

Whether you choose your own topic or one of ours, we'll stick with the same one throughout this course, so it's good go choose one now.
