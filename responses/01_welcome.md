# Welcome!

This course will walk you through creating your own Learning Lab course. If you've ever wanted to create a learning resource using Learning Lab, then you're in the right place! Together, we'll go through:

- Picking a topic
- Breaking the topic down into smaller steps
- Designing a course flow for the learners
- Choosing a project repository
- Mapping the smaller steps into GitHub events
- Writing responses
- Importing and creating your course

### Prerequisites

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

You'll also need a general understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API.  [The Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps) is a good place to start.

:book: The official [Learning Lab docs](https://lab.github.com/docs/writing-quickstart) contain full instructions on how to create courses. We'll link to the docs throughout the course. Take a look if you'd like more information about steps we take in this course.

### Choosing a topic

The first thing we're going to do is talk about and choose a topic.

If you'd like to teach something on Learning Lab, you probably already have something in mind. For this course, you can actually start writing that idea and making it reality! If you're just curious about how to write a course and would rather use our idea, here are a few: like that.

### Things that work with GitHub

Here are some things to think about: Does it happen on GitHub anyway? Learning Lab is best when it's working with something that it can interact with naturally. Things like painting would be difficult! But things that are committed, or interacted with on GitHub, are the perfect fit.

### Scope and size

What's the scope or size? For example, JavaScript makes a lot of sense to teach on Learning Lab because code happens on GitHub. But, it's a really big topic. It may be a good idea to segment your topic into smaller parts, that can be their own Labs, and then users can take a series of Labs. If you aren't sure what the right size is, that's OK - that should become more clear as we go on.

## Step 1: Choose a topic

Whether you choose your own topic or one of ours, we'll stick with the same one throughout this course, so it's good go choose one now.
