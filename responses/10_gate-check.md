I noticed that your commit to the `config.yml` file doesn't have what I am expecting.

I'm using a `gate` and using regular expressions to check your commit. I'm literally checking for something like:

```
type: gate
left:
operator:
right:
```

But, each learner may have a different exact version. Yours may look like:

```
- type: gate
  left: '%payload.pull_request.title%'
  operator: ===
  right: "Creating the config file"
```

Try again by [committing to the `config.yml` file on this branch]({{ url }}), and make sure your changes match my example above. (Make sure your indentations are correct, too!)
