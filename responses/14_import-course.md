# Import your course

Woohoo! You could keep going - but now your course can actually be _tested_. Let's talk about that.

## Importing your course into Learning Lab

When you're ready to start testing your course, you'll need to import it into Learning Lab. Here are a few things you'll need to know.

### Create and test draft courses

When you create a new course on Learning Lab, the course will be [a draft](https://lab.github.com/docs/testing).  While in draft, you can test your course by going to the course dashboard, and clicking on **View course page** next to the course title.

You can continue to [work on your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/testing#test-your-course) while it is in draft -- it will only be visible to you and other administrators of your repo.

### Choosing public vs private courses

Learning Lab courses are public by default. If you'd like to create private courses, you can sign up for the organization plan. Contact learninglab@github.com to learn more.

### Publish a course

When you're ready to [publish your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/publishing), just go to your course's dashboard and click the button! Once published, other users can register for and take your course.

### Maintaining launched courses

Once a course is published, you can continue to make updates to it by using pull requests. When you create a branch and a pull request in an existing course, Learning Lab will automatically create a draft deployment of that pull request so you can test. There will be links directly in your pull request, so you should be able to find it easily. These drafts are only accessible to the owner, or if the owner is an organization, those with administrator access.

### Using the Course Builder

This Learning Lab course has walked you through course creation from scratch - but we also have a Course Builder UI. The Course Builder will create a boilerplate repository and automatically import it for you. It also provides helpful tools to create and validate your course's yaml file. 

## Step 14: Import the course

Importing the course will create the course as a **draft**. While in draft, you can test your courses by going to the course dashboard, and clicking on **View course** page next to the course title.
