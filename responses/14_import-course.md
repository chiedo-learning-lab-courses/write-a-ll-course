# Import your course

Woohoo! You could keep going - but now your course can actually be _tested_. Let's talk about that.

### Importing your course into Learning Lab

When you're ready to start testing your course, you'll need to import it into Learning Lab. Here are a few things you'll need to know.

### Create and test draft courses

When you create a new course on Learning Lab, the course will be [a draft](https://lab.github.com/docs/testing).  While in draft, you can test your course by going to the course dashboard, and clicking on **View course page** next to the course title.

You can continue to [work on your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/testing#test-your-course) while it is in draft. It will only be visible to you and other administrators of your repository.
