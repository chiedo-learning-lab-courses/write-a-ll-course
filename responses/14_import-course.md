    # (Issue) Woohoo! You could keep going, and we will later - but now your course can actually be _tested_. Let's talk about that. 
    # What are draft courses?
    # What are public vs private?
    # How can you keep working once it's launched?
    # Course builder or not course builder?
    # Instructions: Import the course

    Since Learning Lab courses must be owned by your organization, you'll need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the course and template repositories there first. Here are the instructions:

## Create the draft course
1. Choose an organization that will house your Learning Lab courses. You may have done this prior to taking the course.
1. Confirm that you are an owner of the chosen Learning Lab course organization, or a member of a team named **lab-assistants** in that organization.
1. [Fork this repository]({{ url }}) to your chosen organization.
1. [Add the template repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/lab-starter-template/fork) to your chosen organization.
1. Navigate to `{{ host }}/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/new`
1. In the Repository name field, type in **{{ repo }}**.
1. Take the draft course, which should be available at {{ host }}/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/{{ repo }}.

You can continue to [work on your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/testing#test-your-course) while it is in draft -- it will only be visible to you and other administrators of your repo. 

## Publish the course

When you're ready to [publish your course](https://lab.github.com/docs/publishing), just go to your course's administration panel and click the button!
