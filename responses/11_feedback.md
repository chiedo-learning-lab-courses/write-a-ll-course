# Phase 3: Feedback

Nice, now you've got phases one and two covered. It's time for phase 3.

Phase 3 is interesting because what you say depends on what you saw in phase 2. Let's keep it simple for now and have only two possibilities: either the user did it right, or they didn't. This structure is extremely common in Learning Labs right now, but if you use your imagination, you can probably envision more complex possibilities in the future.

## Step 11: Write feedback for the learner

There are two response files in this pull request that I just added - one for the "happy path" where the user did it right, and one to redirect them and give them help to get back on track. Fill in those response files now.

### :keyboard: Activity: Write feedback into the feedback response for the learner to let them know they've done it right

1. Edit the [feedback file, `responses/01_first-feedback.md`, in this pull request]({{ url }}) with feedback about the success of their behavior.
2. Because you are editing multiple files, it will be difficult for me to see that you have modified them both. To let me  know you're done, comment in this pull request.
